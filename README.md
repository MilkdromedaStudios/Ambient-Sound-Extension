# Ambient-Sound-Extension

How to use
Save these files in a folder.

Open Chrome → Extensions → Enable Developer Mode → Load unpacked → select the folder.

Click the extension icon. The tiny controller window opens.

Pick a sound and hit “Open & Play.” A mini popup with the myNoise generator appears; the content script auto-clicks Play.

Use Next/Prev to switch generators. “Focus player” brings the mini window to front if it’s behind other windows.

# Note:

I made this for my personal use.
